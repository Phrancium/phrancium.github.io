Hey there! I'm Frank, currently a Master's Student at the University of Southern California with a passion for AI and Gaming. Right now I'm looking to jumps start my career in either or both of those fields, so please reach out to me at my socials if you have an opportunity!

Right now I'm solo-developing a game where I experiment with using AI to help simulate a smooth flowing conversation between the player and the characters while still sticking to the script and maintaining character and informational consistency. You can check out the prototype [here](https://phrancium.itch.io/a-short-quest) or some other projects I've worked on at the projects page! I have a few other exciting ideas I want to make so stay tuned!
